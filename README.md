# Old Bounty Hunting Missions

Feel like the timed bounty missions in [Endless Sky] (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) are too fast for your taste? Want to stack those jobs, perhaps as a challenge for a ship build or just for that satisfying feeling of credits rolling in after a long patrol? Then this plugin is for you :)

## Technical Stuff

This plugin adds mission definitions that take priority over the one bundled with the game. I copied these from the game files from a continuous build around 09/2022.

## Credits

I thank the original authors and developers of Endless Sky for their work on these missions.

If this breaks license terms in any way, open an issue and I will remove this repo.
